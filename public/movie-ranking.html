<h1>The Best Movies According to Chad</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Kiki's Delivery Service</h3>
<p>This is my favorite anime. Beautiful imagery, excellent plot.</p>
<h3>Blade Runner</h3>
<p>Classic sci-fi. The visuals are stunning and the story is deep.</p>
<h3>Big Trouble In Little China</h3>
<p>An assembling of ecletic things that shouldn't work together but just culminate in the greatest action film of all time.</p>
